    <p>These cookies heal my soul and melt my problems away. They also take over my mind and drive my decisions. They are everything you will ever need to be happy in this life.</p>
    <p>Like all things worth having in life, these cookies take a bit of hard work. These are not for the instant gratifier or the couch potato.

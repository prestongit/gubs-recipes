    <h1>White Chicken Chili</h1>
    <img src="https://easychickenrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/crockpot-white-chicken-chili-IMG_7919-copy.jpg" alt="Delicious bowl of white chicken chili">
    <p>This dish is a spicy, cheesy, and savory hug for your stomach. It is great for cold days and can even be frozen and reheated at later dates for a quick and easy dinner.</p>
    <p>This recipe is best made using the instant pot. The best thing about it is you just throw in all of the ingredients, push the "pressure cook" button and set a time for 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes is up we will let the instant pot release the pressure naturally (usually for about 10 minutes), shred up the chicken, and eat. It is best served with cheese, cilantro, sour cream, and frito scoops.</p>

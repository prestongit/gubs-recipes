    <p>
      This dish is a spicy, cheesy, and savory hug for your stomach. It is great
      for cold days and can even be frozen and reheated at later dates for a
      quick and easy dinner.

      This recipe is best made using the instant pot. The best thing about it is
      you just throw in all of the ingredients, push the "pressure cook" button
      and set a time for 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes is up we will let the
      instant pot release the pressure naturally (usually for about 10 minutes),
      shred up the chicken, and eat. It is best served with cheese, cilantro,
      sour cream, and frito scoops.
